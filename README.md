# Tribute-page - FreeCodeCamp project

### As part of my learning, I tried to get inspiration from other websites and<br> created replicas of their elements.

#### This is a tribute page, with elements replicated from ***Boston Dynamics***.

***

#### This page uses `HTML` and `CSS` and helped me lay down the foundation for:

* Building a page markup and style elements using CSS
* Working with background images and background-blend-modes
* Using Flexbox 
* Better understanding of the box-model and positioning of elements 
* Selectors specificity
* Media queries and setting up breaking points 

#### Things I learned more about, after unexpected behaviours from the page: 

* Cumulative Layout Shift 
* Bootstrap icons 
* Difference in browsers default settings and how to normalize them


***

- [x] I believe this approach helped me a lot to expand my understanding of what I can do with the languages, than what<br>I could have imagined just on my own with a basic understanding of the elements.

#### Check out the result:
